                        This is similar to how a website might be displayed with a trust badge if it
                        properly uses https.</dd>

        <p class="p">TokenScript can't be deployed for production use if it is unsigned. But you can debug an
            unsigned TokenScript (they will be displayed as untrusted by <a class="xref" href="Engine.html" title="A TokenScript engine runs TokenScript">TokenScript Engine</a>).</p>
        
        <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Sometimes, parts of TokenScript have to be signed twice</h2>
            
            <p class="p">We recommend a TokenScript signature always be associated with an identity through an
                certificate.</p>
            <p class="p">However, the Smart Contract might be from a different team than the TokenScript
                author, where wholesale trust to the identity is not possible.</p>
            <p class="p">For example, AAVE team might create a token action for DAI token that is called
                "Enable Deposit to AAVE". This effecitvely authorises Uniswap's smart contract to
                act on-behalf of AAVE token holder. Since such an action transacts to the DAI token
                contract, that token contract need to express trust to that action's code.</p>
            <p class="p">AAVE team reaches out to the DAI team, and ask DAI token contract to express trust by
                identity, in this case, "aave.com". DAI token contract team reasonablly rejected the
                proposal, since they don't know what TokenScript AAVE team will sign - in the worst
                case, it could be a "Try me" action which simply steals user's AAVE tokens from the
                contract.</p>
            <p class="p">In this case, DAI contract will only express trust towards a key associated with the
                identity "makerdao.com". And AAVE team has to send their TokenScript - at least the
                relevant action part - to the DAI team to be signed by that key.</p>
            <p class="p">This would result in a TokenScript that is signed 2 times. </p>
            <p class="p">A <a class="xref" href="Engine.html" title="A TokenScript engine runs TokenScript">TokenScript Engine</a> would identify the two signatures as such: one that
                expresses authorship, the other was trusted by the smart contract through associated
                identity.</p>
            <p class="p">In such a scenario, the identity of the authorship is always displayed to the user,
                while if the user is to perform the action, the express of trust is evaluated and
                the result is displayed together with the identity involved (in this case,
                "makerdao.com").</p>

        <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">It's possible to express trust to a key, instead of an identifer</h2>
            
            <p class="p">Can a smart contract expresses trust to a signing key instead of an identifier such
                as domain name?</p>
            <p class="p">Such a need is discussed in the TokenScript weekly committee meeting however we don't
                know how practically they are needed, so this section is only available for
                implementers as reference material. In that case, each key has a name.</p>

        <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Does the signer need to be the smart contract author?</h2>
        <p dir="ltr" class="p">It's not required, even though it's often the case.</p>
            <p class="p">TokenScript can be maintained by a member of your team who isn't the smart contract
                developer or administrator. In this case, the smart contract needs to express trust
                to the key or the identifier of the key.</p>
        <p dir="ltr" class="p">But it can also be done by another party, which gained trust from the token
                issuer. In this case, it's better if the TokenScript, or the relative portion, be
                signed twice. Once by the author of the TokenScript - aw.app, AlphaWallet, made some
                TokenScript on behalf of the Token Issuer - and once by the Token Issuer
                themselves.</p>

            <p dir="ltr" class="p">Any data reference - icons, images and language packs - used by the
