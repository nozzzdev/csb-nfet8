# Demonstrate how to verify XMLDSIG signature

This repository shows how to verify XMLDSig signature, starting with JavaScript and hope to achieve most programming languages.

Its use is not limited to TokenScript since we are talking about standard XMLDSIG.

## Usage

In all following examples, assume you have cloned [TokenScript-Repo](https://github.com/AlphaWallet/TokenScript-Repo) - a nop-exhaustive TokenScript collection - into your home directory (`~/TokenScript-Repo`) for testing purpose.

Each directory (language version) has a README file. Please check it there for further instructions.
